# travelpage
Travel website project for Code Louisville to complete course requirements for the Front End development class. This is the start of a web page where users will be able to select and arrange their travel destinations based on preference. 
This website has the following code requirements: 
You can find a hamburger menu styled by CSS. 

There is a loading spinner which is incorporated into my hamburger menu and changes position with media queries. 

The elements at the bottom of the page are powered by javascript function which allows users to drag and arrange the elements. 

Lastly there are multiple media queries to make the website responsive on mobile screens.
