# travelpage
Travel website project for Code Louisville to complete course requirements for the Front End development class. This is the start of a web page where users will be able to select and arrange their travel destinations based on preference. 
This website has the following code requirements: 
1. A hamburger menu styled by CSS. 
2. A loading spinner which is incorporated into my hamburger menu and changes position with media queries. 
3. A javascript function which allows users to drag and arrange elements. 
4. There are multiple media queries to make the website responsive on mobile screens.
